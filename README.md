# Kali_JS
Run Kali linux (x86) on your Browser as an emulator! 

 Just a Side-project created for testing & experimentation.

⚠️ **it is just experimentation & it is slower for 32-bit Operating systems. so have patience while booting.**
<br>

If you are willing to try, you may follow these simple steps :
# Install & run :

1) Download Source Code from `release` section & extract the `.zip`
2) Run it locally on your device by python or npx <br>
    ```
    python -m http.server
    ```
     or
   ```
   npx http-server
     ```
3) Finally select the `kali.iso` and Boot it into FailSafe mode (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!) 
  <br> `Note: Other modes won't work , it will result into Kernel panic `

5) Optionally, you can use it to run other x86 images too.
